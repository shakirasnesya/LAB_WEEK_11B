1. When a user takes a picture, the picture is stored in a path based on the given URI.
This is handled in the ProviderFileManager class, specifically in the insertToStore
function where the file is copied into the MediaStore using an InputStream and
OutputStream.

Code:
executor.execute {
    val insertedUri = contentResolver.insert(contentUri, contentValues)
    insertedUri?.let {
        val inputStream = contentResolver.openInputStream(fileInfo.uri)
        val outputStream = contentResolver.openOutputStream(insertedUri)
        IOUtils.copy(inputStream, outputStream)
    }
}

2. In FileInfo.kt:
- The first attribute, URI, refers to a content URI generated by FileProvider. This URI
is used to grant temporary access for the camera application to write the captured
image or video file.
- The fourth attribute, relativePath, refers to the directory path in the MediaStore
where the file will be stored, such as Pictures or Movies.

3. [Bonus]
Chronological order when a user takes a picture:
1) The user presses the photo button in the application.
2) The application generates a file and a secure URI using FileProvider.
3) The camera application is launched using the generated URI.
4) The camera application writes the captured image to the given URI.
5) After the capture is completed, the application inserts the file into the MediaStore.
6) The file is then copied to the MediaStore directory, making it accessible from
the Gallery application.
